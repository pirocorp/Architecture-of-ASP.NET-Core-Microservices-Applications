# Errors In Common.env file

## docker-compose build returns unexpected character "Â»" in variable name near "\ufeff# from evironment file

\ufeff is a the ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE codepoint; it is not rendered when printing. It is used as a byte order mark in UTF-16 and UTF-32 to record the order in which the encoded bytes are to be decoded (big-endian or little-endian).

UTF-8 doesn't need a BOM (it only has one fixed ordering of the bytes, no need to track an alternative), but Microsoft decided it was a handy signature character for their tools to detect UTF-8 files vs. 8-bit encodings (such as most of the windows codepages employ).

### Solution

open script file in Notepad++, go to the "Encoding" tab, select "Encode in UTF-8 without BOM" and save file.

## docker compose up invalid environment variable from environment file

for some reason in my case spaces in variable are problem.

### Solution

Just add value in "". Or use underscore instead of space.

## docker compose up DataProtection-Keys mkdir file exists

volume is created while container is failed to start. And next time when container is configured correctly the volume is in invalid state.

### Solution
deleting volumes relating to the container solves this error.
