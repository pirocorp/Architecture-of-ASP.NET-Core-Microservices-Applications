# Creating Docker Compose File

Defines version of the yml file

```yml
version: "3.8"
```

Services are all managed containers

```yml
services:
```

Data service in this service will be sqlserver. 


```yml
data:
  # Set container name comunication between services (containers) is by name
  container_name: sqlserver  
  # Specifies which image to be used for the container (images are like blueprints)
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
  # Docker host port will be mapped to container port (out:in). 
  # Docker host port (out) will be exposed for comunication.
  ports:
    - "1433:1433"
  # Environment variables
  environment:
    - ACCEPT_EULA=Y
    - SA_PASSWORD=yourStrongPassword12!@
  volumes:
    # volume sqldata is mapped to /var/opt/mssql folder in the container.
    - sqldata:/var/opt/mssql
  networks:
    # this container (service) is part of carrentalsystem-network
    - carrentalsystem-network
```

Identity service is identity micro service

```yml
  identity: 
```

Networks are used to allow comunications between containers. Only containers in one network can comunicate with each other freely.

```yml
networks:
  carrentalsystem-network:
```

Volumes are persistance storages for containers because containers are immutable.
```yml
volumes:
  sqldata:
```

### Dockerfiles

Identity service dockerfile. Can be created from visual studio. Right button over microservice assembly add docker support and choose docker os. Generated docker file for identity micro service.

Dockerfile generated by VisualStudio uses multistage builds. The multistage build allows container images to be created in stages that produce intermediate images.

```dockerfile
# First Stage
# A Dockerfile must begin with a FROM instruction. Specifies the “base image” to use to build our image.
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
# Sets the directory as the working directory for all following commands, 
# so every command is run from inside the app directory.
WORKDIR /app
# Expose exposes the given port outside the container.
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

# Second Stage
# Specifies the SDK for the base image to use.
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
# Changes workdir to src
WORKDIR /src
# COPY <src> <dest>
COPY ["CarRentalSystem.Identity/CarRentalSystem.Identity.csproj", "CarRentalSystem.Identity/"]
COPY ["CarRentalSystem.Common/CarRentalSystem.Common.csproj", "CarRentalSystem.Common/"]
# Executes command restore - restores all NuGet packages.
RUN dotnet restore "CarRentalSystem.Identity/CarRentalSystem.Identity.csproj"
# The COPY . . copies the entire project, recursively into the container for the build.
COPY . .
# Changes workdir to /src/CarRentalSystem.Identity
WORKDIR "/src/CarRentalSystem.Identity"
# Executes command build with output dir /app/build
RUN dotnet build "CarRentalSystem.Identity.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

# Third Stage continious previous stage and renameing it to publish
FROM build AS publish
# Executes command publish with output dir /app/publish
RUN dotnet publish "CarRentalSystem.Identity.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

# Final Stage continious initial stage and renameing it to final
FROM base AS final
# Changes workdir to /app
WORKDIR /app
# opies the contents of output directory from the publish stage into the /app/publish directory of final stage. 
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .1
# command that will start the application
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "CarRentalSystem.Identity.dll"]
```

#### First Stage

The lines in the Dockerfile begin with image from Microsoft Container Registry (mcr.microsoft.com) and create an intermediate image ```base``` that exposes ports 80 and 443, and sets the working directory to ```/app```.

#### Second Stage

You can see that the ```build``` stage starts from a different original image from the registry (```sdk``` rather than ```aspnet```), rather than continuing from base. The ```sdk``` image has all the build tools, and for that reason it's a lot bigger than the aspnet image, which only contains runtime components. The reason for using a separate image becomes clear when you look at the rest of the Dockerfile.

#### Final Stage

The final stage starts again from ```base```, and includes the ```COPY --from=publish``` to copy the published output to the final image. This process makes it possible for the final image to be a lot smaller, since it doesn't need to include all of the build tools that were in the ```sdk``` image.
