# A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user, and consumes PersistentVolume. 
# A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator 
# or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a 
# cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual 
# Pod that uses the PV.
